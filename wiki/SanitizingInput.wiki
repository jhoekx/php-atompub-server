#summary Set up code to sanitize input.

= Introduction =

This document describes a way to sanitize input to a collection. It uses [http://htmlpurifier.org/ HTMLPurifier] to filter the input. The output of the code always has type="xhtml".


= Details =

Download the [http://php-atompub-server.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/collectionspecific/ example file] for the `news` collection from the subversion repository.

After the creation of the App_Servicedoc object, `the collection_specific_dir` member should point to the directory where the `news.php` file exists. Now all requests for the `news` collection pass through that file. Note that it's best to only load HTMLPurifier when it's really needed. It requires a lot of memory.
