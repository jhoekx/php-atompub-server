#summary Quick testing HTTP server

= Introduction =

This document shows how to quickly setup a server for testing. There is no authentication built in currently. You'll need mod_rewrite or similar tools to rewrite everything to the url "handling" code.


= Details =

== Get the server code ==
Check out the latest version of the server software from [http://code.google.com/p/php-atompub-server/source subversion].

== Setting up ==
The example code is in the [http://php-atompub-server.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/app/ subversion repo]. Save it somewhere where it's web-accessible in Apache. Don't forget the `templates` directory!

Now edit the `.htaccess` file of the directory where you've installed the server:
{{{
RewriteEngine On

RewriteRule ^(.+) start.php

DirectoryIndex start.php
}}}

Make sure the server code is in the `../classes/` directory, or change the includes in the start.php file.

== Base URI ==
Proceed to add the base URI of the test site to `start.php`. It should be the URI of the "directory" where that file lives. Be sure to include the final /

== Permissions ==
The web server should have write access to the directory.

== Setting up the service document ==
The example also includes a service document, `service.xml`. It contains a few collections.

== Test it ==
Now, the server should be up and running. Try to access the service document at `$base_uri/service` or $base_uri/ . If that works all is fine, otherwise, ask for help.

In the [http://php-atompub-server.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/ tools section], there's a file `postatom.html`. Save it somewhere on your server, together with the `data.xml` file, which contains a sample entry (straight from the spec) and point your browser at it. It's a crude way to test the functionality.

Good luck!
